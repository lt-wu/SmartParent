## ðŸ“Œ Current Workflow

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Connects to a mail server to read school newsletters.
- Converts emails to PDF format.
- Uses a **multimodal LLM** (e.g., GPT-4 Vision or Gemini) to extract both text and image-based content.

### 2. **Calendar Updates**
- Extracts event details using a **content parser and summary agent**.
- Applies **user-defined rules** (e.g., event type, timing).
- Sets alarms and schedules actions for upcoming days.
- Syncs with Google Calendar (or similar platforms).

### 3. **Chatbot Interaction**
- Builds a **vector database** for storing structured event data.
- Enables a **chat agent** that can:
  - Answer questions about events.
  - Provide preparation details (e.g., forms, supplies).
  - Explain cultural context (e.g., what is "Spirit Day"?).
